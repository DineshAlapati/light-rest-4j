      <description>This is another pattern that is very useful which is a hybrid of chain pattern and aggregate pattern.
This tutorial shows you how to build 4 services in branch pattern.
 API A -&amp;gt; API B -&amp;gt; API D -&amp;gt; API C  API A calls API B and API C. API B calls API D.
Prepare workspace All specifications and code of the services are on github.com but we are going to redo it again by following the steps in the tutorial.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Pattern Microservices</title>

      <description>This is another pattern that is very useful for serving mobile native applications. The mobile app just send one request to the aggregate API and it will call multiple APIs to gether info and send back to the consumer. This avoid mobile device to call multiple APIs to get data on a slow network.
This tutorial shows you how to build 4 services with one of them the aggregator. And it will be the foundation for our microserives benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Registry and Discovery</title>

      <description>Introduction This is a tutorial to show you how to use service registry and discovery for microservices. The example services are implemented in RESTful style but they can be implmented in graphql or hybrid as well. We are going to use api_a, api_b, api_c and api_d as our examples. To simply the tutorial, I am going to disable the security all the time. There are some details that might not be shown in this tutorial, for example, walking through light-codegen config files etc.</description>

      <title>Restful Database Access Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/tutorial/database/</link>

      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/tutorial/database/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Most microservices will have to access database in order to fulfill consumer requests. In this tutorial, we will walk through the following steps with Oracle/Postgres/Mysql for light-rest-4j framework. If you use light-graphql-4j or light-hybrid-4j the steps will be somewhat different but the concept is the same.
 How to setup database connection pool How to connect to the database instance How to do query database tables How to update database tables  Preparation In order to follow the steps below, please make sure you have the same working environment.</description>

      <description>Introduction These days light weight container like Docker is getting traction, more and more API services are developed for docker container and deployed to the cloud. In this environment, traditional heavy weight containers like Java EE and Spring are losing ground as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have a heavy weight container wrapped with a light weight docker container. Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are replacing all the functionalities Java EE provides without hogging resources.</description>
